 <h3>Introduction</h3>



    
<p2> Environmental studies is a multidisciplinary academic field which systematically studies human interaction with the environment. Environmental studies connects principles from the physical sciences, commerce/economics, the humanities,and social sciences to address complex contemporary environmental issues.</p2>  
<h3>History</h3> 
<p2>  The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University established a BS in environmental studies degree in the 1950s, awarding its first degree in 1956.Middlebury College established the major there in 1965.

The Environmental Studies Association of Canada (ESAC) was established in 1993 "to further research and teaching activities in areas related to environmental studies in Canada". ESAC's magazine, A\J: Alternatives Journal was first published by Robert A. Paehlke on 4 July 1971.

In 2008, The Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences (AESS) was founded as the first professional association in the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies in the United States. In 2010, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) agreed to advise and support the Association. In March of 2011, The Association's scholarly journal, the Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences (JESS), commenced publication.

In the United States, many high school students are able to take environmental science as a college-level course.Over 500 colleges and universities in the United States offer environmental studies as a degree.</p2>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p3>Worldwide, programs in environmental studies may be offered through colleges of liberal arts, life science, social science or agriculture. Students of environmental studies use what they learn the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to better understand environmental problems and potentially offer solutions to them. Students look at how we interact with the natural world and come up with ideas to prevent its destruction</p3>
